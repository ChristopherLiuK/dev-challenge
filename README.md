# Dev Challenge (Short)

Some improvements to have into consideration before sending the application to production:

- Containerize the application to ensure that it can be run in any environment.
- Usage of Swagger/OpenAPI to document the API.
- Update to a real database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc).
- Instead of handling exceptions with try catch, use ControllerAdvice to centralize handling of exceptions.
